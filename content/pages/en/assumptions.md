title: Assumptions
---
The articles in this blog are written by a random pleb.  
I don't consider myself an expert in any of the fields I'm writing.  
I'm only sharing my personal experiences in the fields I'm interested in.  
The main goal of the blog is to improve my writing skills in **English**, **Spanish**, **Italian** and to receive constructive feedbacks to improve my knowledge and procedures.

The audience I'm expecting shares my same personal situation:  
I'm a location independent guy, I spend most of my time between 3 countries and 2 continents.  
In the content of this blog, this means I can't relay on a personal home server always powered and online.  
Therefore, solutions like [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/) or [self-hosted LND node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) are not viable and will not be considered in my articles.  
I'm particularly interested in investigating alternative solutions for people on my same situation that want to preserve their privacy and security.

I will write about:
- **Location independence** (a term that I much prefer over the *digital nomad* buzzword) and all the related matters, with a special focus to **personal finance** for a bitcoiner that still needs to deal with a fiat world.
- Online **privacy** and **security** (and maybe offline? Who knows, we will see).
- **Web development** with the frameworks I use: Nuxtjs for frontend and Nodejs for backend and online businesses in general like SEO and such.
