title: Assumptions
---
The articles in this blog are written by a random pleb.  
I don't consider myself an expert in any of the fields I'm covering.  
I'm only sharing my personal experiences in these fields.  
The main goals of the blog are:
- Improve my writing skills in **English**, **Spanish**, **Italian**.
- **Test Nuxt** futures before using them in my production projects.
- Receive constructive **feedbacks** to improve my knowledge and procedures.

I assume that the audience is not sharing my same views but the same situation:  
I'm a location independent guy, I spend most of my time between 3 countries and 2 continents.  
This means I can't relay on a personal home server always powered and online.  
Therefore, solutions like [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/) or [self-hosted LND node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) are not viable and will not be considered in my articles.  
I'm particularly interested in investigating alternative solutions for people on my same situation that want to preserve their privacy and security.

I will write about:
- **Location independence** (a term that I much prefer over the *digital nomad* buzzword) and all the related matters, with a special focus to **personal finance** for a bitcoiner that still needs to deal with a fiat world.
- Online **privacy** and **security** (and maybe offline? Who knows, we will see).
- **Web development** with the frameworks I use: Nuxtjs for frontend and Nodejs for backend and online businesses in general like SEO and such.
