## Sparrow wallet daily use
### Mandatory note in outgoing transactions
You will notice that when sending a bitcoin trnasaction form your wallet, apart from the received address amount and fee, you will be asked for a mandatory note.  
I asked in the Sparrow telegram group why the note is mandatory and the answer I get is that without a note you wont be able in the future to recognize KYC utxo fron KYC free trnasactions.  
This helped me to start writing proper notes. I will explain what I mean with an example:  
Let‚Äôs say I have an utxo with 0.1 btc KYC free.  
I deposit 0.05 btc from that utxo to [Xapo Bank](/en/articles/xapo-bank) to pay with their debit card my next flight to Argentina.  
The change that I get for this transaction is now KYCed, becase my account at Xapo is verified with my name and documents and because they know the receiving address for the change.  
Until my question in the group, my note would have been ‚Äúflight to Argentina‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt apport anything.    
I understood that it makes much more sense to note ‚Äú KYCed deposit to Xapo‚Äù, so next year when I want clean by KYCed utxo, I know this is one that I have to mix.
